⚠️ Important Note: Contact Form Functionality

This website is designed as a Full Stack Application.

On the Live Demo (GitHub Pages):
Since GitHub Pages only hosts static content (Frontend), the Contact Form is in "UI Demo Mode". It simulates a successful submission for demonstration purposes but does not connect to a live server.

In Local Development:
When running locally with the Java Spring Boot backend active, the form sends real POST requests to http://localhost:8080/api/contact, and the data is processed and logged by the Java server.

🛠️ How to Run Locally (Full Stack)

To see the full connection between React and Java, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/0Naveen2/portfolio.git](https://github.com/0Naveen2/portfolio.git)

2. Setup Backend (Java Spring Boot)

Navigate to the backend folder.

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.

Run DemoApplication.java.

Server starts on: http://localhost:8080

3. Setup Frontend (React)

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5173
